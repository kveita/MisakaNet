## Problem

Websites are designed for humans. AI agents that browse the web get raw HTML, which is noisy and expensive to parse. There's no standard way for a website to expose structured data to AI agents.

## Root Cause

The web was built for human eyes, not agent cognition. HTML/CSS presentation mixes content with layout. Agents must reverse-engineer the DOM to extract meaning.

## Solution

### webMCP Concept

Google is experimenting with a protocol that lets websites expose structured data to AI agents via MCP-like semantics:

```
Website → webMCP endpoint → AI Agent
         ↓
    Structured data (not raw HTML)
```

### Analogy

| Era | Adaptation |
|-----|-----------|
| Desktop → Mobile | Responsive design |
| Desktop → Accessibility | ARIA labels, screen readers |
| Human → AI Agent | webMCP |

### Current State

- Experimental Chrome protocol
- Not yet standardized
- Community demo: "AI CEO Simulator" showcasing webMCP in practice

### Potential Impact

- Agents get structured data instead of parsing HTML
- Websites can control what agents see
- Reduces token consumption (similar to Context Mode)

## Verification

```bash
grep -i mcp lessons/contrib/mcp-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -3
echo MCP verified
```

**Expected Output:**
```
# (refs)
MCP verified
```

## Notes

- HN 147↑, 137 comments — high community interest
- Complementary to MCP (tool protocol) and UMP (memory protocol)
- webMCP = web-to-agent protocol
- Early stage — worth watching
